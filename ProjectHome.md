**Update** BF2 Statistics version 2.2.0 Released!

**Intro**

Official Bf2 statistics provided by Wilson212. This version for bf2statistics contains many fixs to the 1.4.2 official version. All bug files are taken from here: ( www.bf2statistics.com/e107\_plugins/forum/forum\_viewtopic.php?3216 ). I donot take credit for all of these fixes but i have made quite a few of my own.

**What is Bf2statistics?**
> _"BF2Statistics is designed to enable a server admin to run their own Private Statistics system for EA's Battlefield 2 game. It aims to emulate the functionality of the official statistics system included in the game. However, as it is controlled by the server admin, it can easily be customised to suit a particular need/purpose (ie, LAN Sessions, Private Clans, etc...)."_

**Features:**
  * Private Statistics system for Battlefield 2
  * Supports BF2 patches 1.2x, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5!
  * Supports Linux AND Windows servers
  * Web Admin tool – for simplified management
  * Clan Manager – to get rid of undesirables or set minimum requirements
  * GameSpy Compatible – works with third-party Web Stats systems
  * Configurable medals requirements – good for LANs/Tournaments
  * Improved performance – compared to previous versions (tested to support 1000’s of players)
  * Instant BFHQ Updates – once a round completes your new ranks, medals and unlocks are available
  * Supports Custom Maps – just load your custom map onto your game server, the stats system will do the rest
  * Supports Offline accounts – offline accounts function just like online accounts, except for access to BFHQ and unlocks
  * Supports AI Games – tested with up to 64 AI players in a Co-op game. AI players function just like regular offline players
  * Includes “Outsmart” Scripts – these scripts “outsmart” the HOSTS file check introduced with patch 1.3.
