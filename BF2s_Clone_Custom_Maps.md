# BF2s Clone - Custom Maps #

Whenever you play a custom map, BF2s Clone just says "N/A" as the map name. The reason being, is you need to add the map name to the map list.

To add your custom map:
  * go -> Your BF2s folder /queries/
  * Open the file called "maps.list"
  * add your map in the following format: " map id|map name "
  * Save that file.
  * Next, if you are not using a mod, open "maps-bf.list". Add your Map id to the list.
  * This next part inst essential, but recommended. Create a 64x64 image of the map and place it in: -> /game-images/maps/map\_MAPID.jpg.
  * That is it!

Now when you play a custom map, it will display the map on the players stats page correctly, As well as add the time played to that map to your BF2 overall time.
